Problem Statement:

We have a dataset containing information about users of a bank, with various fields such as:

*RowNumber * *CustomerId * *Surname * *CreditScore * *Geography * *Gender * *Age * *Tenure * *Balance * *NumOfProducts * *HasCrCard * *IsActiveMember * *EstimatedSalary * Exited

In this dataset, some users remain with the bank (stay), while others decide to leave. Our task is to predict which users are likely to stay with the bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Objective:

The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify users into two categories:

Stay: Users who will continue using the bank's services. Leave: Users who are likely to stop using the bankâ€™s services.
